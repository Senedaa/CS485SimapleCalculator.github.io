<h3>Simple Calculator</h3>
This calculator offers six operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation represented by the symbols "+", "-", "*", "/", "%", and "**" respectively. The user interacts with the calculator through a dropdown list to select the desired operation. Upon entering two numbers, the result is dynamically updated based on the chosen operator.
To ensure input reliability, the calculator performs a sanity check. It verifies if the input is not blank or contains non-numeric characters, displaying an error message, "Error, Please Enter Valid Input" in such cases. Special attention is given to division and modulus operations, where the calculator checks if the second number is zero, signalling an error with the message "Invalid Division by Zero" to the user. In addition, I made my calculator to accept float numbers, because a user can enter numbers in digits, and I made it this happen by parsing to float to the input of the user.
